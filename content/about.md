# ABOUT(1)

## NAME
About - A seasoned developer's journey and interests.

## SYNOPSIS
A personal account of a developer's experiences, challenges, and passions.

## DESCRIPTION
I'm a seasoned developer with experience ranging from hosting vendor solutions to writing custom solutions. Over the years, I've worked on several side projects—none of which you would have heard about because they were all niche and never had plans to make any money, lol. They were just learning tools to help me accomplish a task that I wanted to achieve.

I enjoy roller coasters, solving problems, harassing my kid, spending time with my wife, and talking tech. I never really get enough of talking about tech. I wake up thinking of tech, work in tech, eat tech for lunch, and sleep with tech on my mind. It's one thing in this crazy world that I can control... mostly... and within the guardrails of the requirements, lol. I may not have a say in WHAT we develop, but I definitely have a say in HOW we develop it.

Currently, I'm working for Crown Lift Trucks, developing integrations, internal and external apps, and generally learning everything I can about the place.

I spend most of my time developing using Java in a Spring Boot context along with the occassional dip into TypeScript and Angular.  But for the most part I spend my time with integration tasks or services, back office type stuff.  I enjoy being back there the responsibilities are high but it's generally pretty chill as we have a workaround for everything...
