# ABOUT

I'm a seasoned developer with experience ranging from hosting vendor solutions to writing custom software. Over the years, I've worked on several side projects—none of which you would have heard about because they were all niche and never intended to make money. These projects were simply learning tools to help me achieve specific goals and expand my skills.

I enjoy roller coasters, solving problems, spending time with my family, and diving deep into tech discussions. Technology is a constant in my life—something I wake up thinking about, work with throughout the day, and even dream about at night. It's one of the few things in this unpredictable world that I can control... well, mostly, within the guardrails of requirements. While I may not always have a say in what we develop, I take pride in influencing how we develop it.

Currently, I work for Crown Lift Trucks, where I develop integrations, internal and external applications, and continuously learn about the organization. My primary focus is on Java development within a Spring Boot context, with occasional forays into TypeScript and Angular. Most of my time is spent on integration tasks and back-office services—areas where the stakes are high, but the environment is generally relaxed, thanks to the availability of workarounds for almost everything.
