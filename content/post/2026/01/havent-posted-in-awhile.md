I was going to try and keep a weekly cadence for my blog posts but honestly I haven't been exploring much new.  I've just been using what I have setup such as my open-webui which now has an app on my phone that connects to it.  That app only cost me 3.99 on the app store and it's quite polished.  Well worth the 4 bucks.  I've tied all of my default search engines to be my searxng instance and I've been loving it.  The results are great, there's no ads or LLM's to fuss with and it has plenty of the features that the big engines have such as a videos tab, images tab, etc.  I highly recommend setting up your own instance, it barely uses any resources.

I've been just using my os which is still CachyOS with a vanilla arch kernel.  Runs stable, fast and has been more than reliable.  Games are still running smoothly, I've stepped back from EVE as markets have just crashed and made things less profitable so it's not worth all the effort.  I've instead picked up Saelig and have spent a good 200 hours in there simulating 6 generations of a family and their first born.  That has been fun and interesting, I highly recommend this game if you like simulations.  You go from whatever kind of start you want from a beggar to a trust fund baby and you can pick any path you want.  Wanna just pick pockets... go for it but you'll end up in the pit time and time again :D.  Wanna be a business mogul, go for it.  Wanna have a rental empire, sure thing.

Other than that my computing life has been awesomely boring.  No hitches in Cachy or Omarchy.  Minor hitch on the vanilla arch server but I worked through it just fine.  Things are peachy.
