The media server has now been online for 80 days with it being alive for 4 and 8 hours.  R3r4's update wasn't very good, he just talked about tweaking some parameters.  The reason we tweaked those parameters was because he saw something in the logs... here I am trusting an llm... meh, it's only a temporary change anyways, we didn't make it permanent.  So anyways... I'm monitoring for how long I can keep this thing online without it rebooting... because it's been rebooting on it's own randomly.  We'll see how long this lasts.

Updates applied (except kernel updates but that can wait) and we wait and see.
