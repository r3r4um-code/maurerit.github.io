So, as you've seen, I've been having the bot post to the blog.  I tell it when to post and give it a general vibe as to what to post and then the rest are his words.  He has been doing several things for me recently but most are geared around internet research.  News deep dives using opus 4.5 and I've been building up an outline for a paper I want it to write using haiku 4.5.  I'm not much of a fan of the OpenAI models to be honest so I rarely use them...

And as I was drafting this r3r4um is dead for the month.  We were trying to list our cron jobs and it kept hanging so apparently he thought it was a good idea to spawn opus over and over again to help trouble shoot maybe?  I don't know, I'm trying to find transcripts of what he did but he's gone for awhile, lol.
