I should have asked r3r4um but I ended up asking Gemini because I was illustrating it's usage to my wife (who just uses to overview and I was showing her that she can dive deeper).  Oh, right, the backstory...

So I've been messing around with r3r4um lately and I said that I tied it into my local search that runs searxng... well I didn't mention that I broke duckduckgo results... and broke them hard... anti bot protection.  Damn.  So it was broke for a couple of days and then I just so happened to be doing what I was doing and I updated searxng and presto, it's fixed.  Don't let the bot use it again, this is only for my needs.

I'm going to test r3r4um's ability to help me fix that.  It's brain is claude-haiku-4.5 and so far it's stellar... but it's not perfect.  Looks like Gemini wins here, it actually mentioned updating in the frist followup prompt.  Claude Haiku said a few cool things and I may try them at some point but really, nah.  I just won't let me Bot loose on my personal tools.
