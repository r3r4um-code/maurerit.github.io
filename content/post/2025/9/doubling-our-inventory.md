Things have been going somewhat smoothly with our industrial ambitions in EVE.  We've been mostly maintaining our inventory on the market but sometimes factories get over stressed and we can't meet demand.  Then we fall behind and others capitalize on the decreased market presence.  I'd like to get to a point where we have no lulls in restocking so we're doubling our inventory.  We'll keep half of our inventory listed and half at the factory staged for the market.  We'll then attempt to double our build materials for agility in the future in case killer deals come around.

This is going to involve quite the bit of logistical work.  I imagine I'll have to transport a couple billion worth of moon mats and fuel into our reaction system, run tons of reactions and then build the construction components.  We'll also need to replenish our PI mats but that will stretch our extraction processes to their max.  One of our members is producing around 8000 p3's a week for us and we've been consuming all of what they've been able to extract.  This small push may lead us to buy off the market for a batch or so.  We'll see.

The next order of business will be to replenish our T1 base products for all the t2 things we're producing.  We're currently building enough to double our inventory for the initial build to double our sellable inventory.  This proccess is going to take several days, we're about 3 days in and half way done maybe.  I'm not sure how long the t2 builds will take but we can usually knock out about 2 batches a day each so that's 7 characters producing at full tilt which is ~1400 of each item a day.  I figure we have 4 products where we want 1600 products in stock, 5 products where we want 3200 in stock and 1 product with 2000 in stock.  That brings us to around 17 days worth of factory time.  Wow, that's pretty intense for some small t2 products.

With the tracking that my new app gives us we can easily stock pile as long as we have no major price shifts in input materials.  Building stocks like this is risky though due to potential swings but everything has been very stable lately so here's to hoping we don't lose a ton of value.

Off to new limits!
