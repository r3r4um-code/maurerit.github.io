Things have been going somewhat smoothly with our industrial ambitions in EVE. We've mostly been maintaining our inventory on the market, but sometimes factories get over-stressed and we can't meet demand. Then we fall behind and others capitalize on the decreased market presence. I'd like to get to a point where we have no lulls in restocking, so we're doubling our inventory. We'll keep half of it listed and half staged at the factory for the market. We'll then attempt to double our build materials for agility in the future in case killer deals come around.

This is going to involve quite a bit of logistical work. I imagine I'll have to transport a couple billion ISK worth of moon mats and fuel into our reaction system, run tons of reactions, and then build the construction components. We'll also need to replenish our PI mats, but that will stretch our extraction processes to their max. One of our members is producing around 8,000 P3s a week for us and we've been consuming all of what they've been able to extract. This small push may lead us to buy off the market for a batch or so. We'll see.

The next order of business will be to replenish our T1 base products for all the T2 things we're producing. We're currently building enough to double our inventory for the initial push. This process is going to take several days—we're about three days in and maybe halfway done. I'm not sure how long the T2 builds will take, but we can usually knock out about two batches a day each, so that's seven characters producing at full tilt which is ~1,400 of each item a day. We have four products where we want 1,600 in stock, five products where we want 3,200 in stock, and one product with 2,000 in stock. That brings us to around 17 days of factory time. Wow, that's pretty intense for some small T2 products.

With the tracking that my new app gives us, we can easily stockpile as long as we have no major price shifts in input materials. Building stocks like this is risky due to potential swings, but everything has been very stable lately, so here's to hoping we don't lose a ton of value.

Off to new limits!
