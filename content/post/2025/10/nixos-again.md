I booted back into NixOS for the first time in around a month and I just don't know what to do next with it.  I mean, it's perfectly usable as is.  Everything I want besides libreoffice is already installed, my shell is setup the way I like it and it quite frankly just feels good.  But that is mainly KDE and not NixOS.  I'm not comfortable with NixOS in the cli nor am I really equipped to deal with my config.  It's not too large yet but when I just want to install a new package I have to edit a config, save it, run a command and wait for it to (I think) do a full update and install the package and create a snapshot.  Quite frankly, I think I'll backup my config here and wipe this drive and reclaim it for the main OS.

Although I don't know what I'll do with another terabyte besides expand my btrfs pool to 2tb again.  Whatever that buys me.  I'm finding that I'm not wanting to be on the computer as much anymore.  Maybe I'm just in a down cycle for computers.  I am still doing stuff with Omarchy and I'm really loving it.  Not necessarly that it's Omarchy but hyprland is actually quite nice with that setup.  I almost want to try and get nix all setup with hyprland.

Maybe I'll get the motivation for that at a later date.
