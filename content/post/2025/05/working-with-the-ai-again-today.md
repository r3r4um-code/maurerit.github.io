Today I'm working with Junie on the java backend of my vs-industry project and I find myself quite a bit less confident in the changes made by the AI.  I've already gone through and cleaned up some junior level code and now find myself ready to test the changes but I'm afraid to hit the go button...  I think because this side of the equation is a touch more permanent... there are database changes involved and the code is executed through a scheduled task with no manual way of triggering yet so I have to wait for an execution.  Of course I could create the controller... but why?

Let's just send it!
