How does this even begin to make sense.  Wendy's had a deal running on doordash where you get a free Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger if you spend 25.  We like the deal but we're not shooting for it, so we order.  Things were weird, at first I had 2 fries in with our order and the total came out to like 22 dollars.  Then I took a frie off and the total went up to 25... seeing that I go back and order a Jr. Bacon... come back to the check screen and the total is now 29 with a 4 dollar discount... wait... WHAT?  How does your math even begin to add up.

Doordash hidden costs.
