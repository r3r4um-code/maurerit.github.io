I really want to get EVE to work on Bottles and Wine and Lutris. Why do I want all of them? Because people say they work, and I feel like I'm crazy because I can't get them to work. I've managed to get Wine partially working using wine-staging, but it binds up to my iGPU instead of my dGPU, which is rather annoying. I don't partake in fleet fights or any kind of activity of that nature; I play with graphics on high... I need my dedicated GPU. Bottles and Lutris have this switch to force the dGPU... I want to see if it works.

I've run into what seem like very common errors. While installing EVE in Bottles, I've encountered the privileged user issue. Somehow I feel like I've managed to get past that and seen the electron issue as well, but I could be wrong. With the latest launcher updates, I'm getting more involved with the community. Not necessarily talking—I couldn't care less about my voice being heard in a large crowd—but at least hanging out and learning from all the people in the community. A person who goes by the name GreenXenith said something that may end up finally helping me get EVE installed in these apps. At least Bottles, since that's what his post concentrates on.

He said: ![GreenXenithPost](../GreenXenithTipOnBottles.png "GreenXenith talks about getting EVE installed in Bottles")

Basically, he suggests using different runners to accomplish different tasks. Talk about a pain in the ass! How does someone struggle that long with that much patience to discover this? Perseverance for the win.

Never give up!
