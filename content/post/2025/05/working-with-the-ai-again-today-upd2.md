It's so much fun to watch the AI work and do what I think to be emergent behavior.  Like for instance, a TODO I slapped on a small block of code.  I put it there because of course I was going to come back to this and add more things.  So I had the AI do this.  It removed the TODO for me as part of the update without me mentioning it.  It's also updating java docs to be correct to match the internal algorithm.  Good stuff.

Keep on Vibin!
