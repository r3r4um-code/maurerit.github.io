Traffic was packed on the highway today. So much so that I needed to get away from all of those people. None of them could drive and it was driving me insane. So I got off the highway at the next stop and headed for a state route. These are always fun to drive. They're long and boring and filled with run down farms. It's interesting to see how a huge portion of our land supports so few people on it.

This got me thinking—this is what vibe coding has been for me. Getting off the beaten path and onto something less traveled. This hype is sweeping through the tech community, with good and bad impressions. For creating the new... not so good. For making the tried and true, quite good. It's been a sort of 'palette refresher'.

What have you done to get off of your beaten path and refresh your palette lately?
