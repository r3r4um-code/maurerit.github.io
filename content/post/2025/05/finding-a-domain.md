I used to own maurer-it.net, mainly because maurer.net was taken by someone in Germany. I was never the fondest of the domain, but it worked and it was mine. I hosted some stuff for myself there, had an email server for a while before securing them was really a thing.

Now I want another domain, but maurer.dev is taken... WHY DOES MY LAST NAME HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE COOL DOMAINS TAKEN? :(
