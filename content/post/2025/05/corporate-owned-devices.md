I've never been a fan of having to use someone else's device to work for them. They're in control, you always feel like you're trespassing, and it's just not a good feeling in the least. And, when something breaks... you have to wait for help desk to prioritize your ticket. That's the state that I'm currently in. VS Code just somehow broke around 11:30, I suppose. I was in another program around then until lunch. Came back after lunch and all of a sudden things were acting funny. I closed VS Code and tried to reopen it... error. Now I'm at the mercy of the corporate overlords.

I opened a ticket and waited. Right before a meeting, support reached out and told me that they've had another person with the same problem who encountered it after a Windows update. They said they'll just reinstall VS Code and ship me a password to be used... I sure hope that password is temporary... Not that I can do much; they actually have these computers locked down pretty hard. I know for sure because I had installed 1Password when I joined, and they emailed me a few weeks later saying they were going to remove it as it's not approved software. From that day forward, I haven't tried to install anything else. The other things I installed were approved apparently, which makes sense because they were all developer tools that all of us require.

Don't get me wrong, I fully understand why all of the restrictions are in place. It's not JUST about the security of the device but the security of ALL the other devices on the network.

I'm just complaining in general.
