It's now been 8 days or so and I haven't heard much on the launcher front for EVE.  What is known so far is that the latest launcher 1.10.0 is borked in wine.  No messages that point to obvious problems... just fails to launch.  I did read that someone is working with someone else from proton and trying to provide logs.  So let's hope that effort is fruitful because I'll eventually NEED to upgrade this launcher I imagine.

I'm trying to go back through my memory and piece together what it was that I did to actually fix the problem.  I _know_ I 'rolled back' by deleting the latest version of the launcher in my steam prefix.  I thought I did something with the steam console like [this](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-launcher-on-linux-lutris-not-working-after-launcher-update-5-08-2025/485547/22?u=marq_aideron) post calls out and I do recall completely deleting all my eve data but thankfully the REALLY important things to me are server side.  Damnit, I wish I could remember EXACTLY what I did, I'll be doing a better job of that in the coming days.

I'm still operational with the 1.9.4 launcher version and it isn't pestering me for upgrades... I wonder if I broke something else.  Simple fix is to rename the 1.9.4 folder to 1.10.0 :D.  I'll make a copy this time instead of completely moving over 1.9.4 into 1.10.0.  I shouldn't have deleted 1.10.0 and instead copied it for later.  Like maybe some idle time troubleshooting.  Oh well, I guess if I'm so inclined I can download the launcher manually, someone at ccp provided the url for where the launchers come from.

Onto the next adventure.
