I've been using Claude 3.7 sonnet in VS Code to review and update my posts.  The edits have been small but pretty major.  Stuff like comma's and flow.  I tend to write run on sentences or sentence fragments without a full idea pushed through.  Claude has been quite helpful in finding those.

This is just a disclaimer that while I use AI, I don't use it to WRITE my posts.  The idea's and general flow come from me.
