As I've said in a prior post, I'm currently running both CachyOS and Debian.  I've been mostly in Cachy for the past week or two and its been great.  But now that I'm switching back and forth a bit more researching things I want to share my Brave tabs between the two OSes...

Time to dig and see what I can do.
