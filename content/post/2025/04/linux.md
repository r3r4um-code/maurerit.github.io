I finally decided to go full time Linux.  I was on Windows 11 with this new laptop because of course your laptop will come with windows... what other operating system is there?  I couldn't really stand it though and I used it less and less after the novelty of the hardware wore off.  This was strictly windows' fault.  It's lack of customization, terrible terminal and scripting languages, stupid drives instead of mountpoints... and it's slow...  So off to Linux I went.

I wasn't sure what distro I wanted to run so I browsed through all the big names and even downloaded an arch iso.  I tried Mint, Fedora, Debian, Nobara, openSUSE and Pop!_OS.  I REALLY wanted Pop!_OS to work but I couldn't get EVE Online running properly.  Not through steam, not through lutris and not through bottles.  I didn't try vanilla wine though, maybe I should have.  I was able to get Debian, Fedora, Nobara and Mint to work through steam so they were all on the short list.  I hate rpm's though due to my past before a package manager hit RedHat (my first distro years ago).  So that left me with Debian and Mint.

I'm fine with Debian.  It's slow to adopt new packages, plenty stable and a familiar package manager.  Bookworm wasn't nearly as behind the times as I thought it would be and I'm still not really needing anything outside of the Debian repositories besides a few proprietary apps.  Such as discord, intellij, 1password and I believe Brave came from their own repositories.  I also have an EVE Online intell tool installed from another location.  Other than those apps I'm really only using Flatpak's and the apt repos I mentioned.  It's been awhile now, maybe 1.5 months or so and Debian is working out great.

Mint was ok, I didn't spend a WHOLE lot of time over there but I like some of the things they did.  They're proprietary drier manager is nice, the default layout is familiar and friendly... because it looks like windows out of the box and it had some customizations.  The main thing that turned me off though was it's lack of ability to turn the touchpad speed slower.  Damn does that thing move fast without tweaking it.

Getting up and running was pretty straight forward.  I found the documentation on how to get the proprietary Nvidia drivers installed and enabled 32 bit things for steam.  Steam came from non-free I think?  Not sure exactly which repo it came from but they don't do anything to keep steam from updating itself so at least THAT's up to date.

Everything isn't perfect but by far it's better than windows.  My apps are snappy, the apps I develop are snappier and the system as a whole is just more comfortable for me.  I've had issue's however.  For some reason my bluetooth mouse will no longer pair with the pc so I had to resort to the RF module that it came with.  I didn't have window previews when hovering over them in my task bar but I managed to dig up help on that one and got it working.  EVE doesn't always run at max framerates causing me to have to reboot more often than I normally would.  I'll blame that on being a laptop and assume Linux doesn't sleep very well still.  OBS sometimes loses the ability to capture my screen.  I still haven't figured that one out but I fixed it somehow, maybe it was just a reboot too... I can't remember.  Other than those issue's though I haven't had any serious problems with the os.

Software development on Linux has always been good.  Compilers run fast, apps seem like they have nothing getting in their way and I much prefer GNU cli tools over windows tools.  Now, in windows I always have the Git for windows package installed so that brings with it some GNU tools which I end up using instead of cmd.exe.  It's OK doing that... still windows but at least the cli feels better.  Docker is also part of my general workflow.  I like docker build images because you ALWAYS have a fresh environment for building so I can guarantee the apps will build whereever I pull them down.  Docker on windows... garbage.  Maybe it's better now, who knows but I hated Docker Desktop on my Mac and on my previous windows computer so I never installed it on my laptop.

Gaming on Linux... damn do I love it.  Thanks Valve for putting so much work into the Steam Deck and into proton.  You've really changed the landscape.  With virtual desktops, multiboxing in EVE is so much easier.  I don't do much combat so I'm mainly switching between industry characters hauling things, building things, auditing things and resetting things.  My current setup works wonderfully for all of that.  Just a simple 3 finger swipe to get to my other character and it feels natural.  The muscle memory comes quick too.  I've thoroughly enjoyed running my favorite games in this OS.
